## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I met up with Steve, and we were able work together to complete the torrent builder function. The backend
can now successfully build a new torrent file based on a file on the user's filesystem.

## This Week's Plan

This weeks plan is to incorporate the building of torrent into the UI. This will require me to create the API & front end
component for the feature.

## Anything Blocking?

Knowledge of Vim & Rouille will be a learning curve.
