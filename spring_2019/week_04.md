## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I was able to implement a basic dialog box with Vue.js to enter in the file you wish to create the torrent off of. Current it has default parameters set for the rest of the 
input the API consumes, so I need to make this a form that has the user enter in all of the informaton. Plus I wish to use a file picker dialog rather than the user entering the path to the 
file on their system.

I realized I never put in what I did for this project in the very beginning of the semester. During the beginning, I was working on transmission-sys mainly. I was able to make a breakthrough 
on being able to fully bind transmission's C library to Rust. I was able to make a proof of concept with binding all of the third-party resources then binding transmission itself. Steve was able
to take this and make it production ready. I was also in the process of coverting all of the transmission-sys's CLI tooling to rust, but I delayed then since it wasn't a main task.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to learn more about the BitTorrent protocol as well as finish my Vue.js component. I want to learn about the BitTorrent protocol since Steve and I discussed that a future
goal of this project is to have its own BitTorrent library. With rust, it will be entirely memory safe while still being efficient.


## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking.
