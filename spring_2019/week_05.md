## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I was able to implement a feature to allow the user to click on the file card anywhere rather than just the file header from before.
I was also able to fix a UI bug (tool-tip being covered from other components). This is essential to our project since we are focusing on accessibility and UX.

## This Week's Plan

This weeks plan I hope to polish out anymore bugs in the backend on UX so we can release 0.1.0. I also plan to begin implementing the authentication system for our second release.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking.
