## Last Week's Accomplishments

I was able to create the functions more specifically fit for our project. I was
originally using generic get/puts but i moved it to a more specific module.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on cleaning up my functions as well as begin to lay out a schema for our DB.

## Anything Blocking?
