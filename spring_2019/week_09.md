## Last Week's Accomplishments

I ported over the crypto functions and imported them into the state manager. I was able to also create some tests for these which I plan to send a MR over to the observatory-new project. 
I was able to begin to prototype a login system API.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on porting over the crypto functions made by Steve in his observatory rewrite to help with the login system.

## Anything Blocking?
